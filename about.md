[Animint](https://github.com/tdhock/animint) is an R package designed to allow R users to create *anim*ated and *int*eractive web graphics directly from R.  Users create plots using the [ggplot2 package](http://ggplot2.org/) with some [additional features](https://github.com/tdhock/animint/wiki/Advanced-features-present-animint-but-not-in-ggplot2) and aesthetics.  The user then passes the plots off to animint which compiles the plots and renders them as an SVG vizualization that can be viewed from any modern web browser.

To learn more about animint, check out the [README](https://github.com/tdhock/animint#animint---an-r-package-for-animated-interactive-web-graphics).  To get started using it, take a look at Susan VanderPlas' [animint tutorial](http://tdhock.github.io/animint/).  Then get inspired with [some examples](https://github.com/tdhock/animint/wiki/Gallery).  If you use animint, please add your work to [the Gallery](https://github.com/tdhock/animint/wiki/Gallery).
