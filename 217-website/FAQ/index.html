				<h2 id="need-computer">Do I need a computer?</h2>
				<p>A computer is not required, but it will be helpful to complete homeworks.</p>
				<p>If you do not have a computer, you will need to use a computer in either the Roberts Hall computer lab (ROBH 101) or the Reid Hall computer lab (REID 306).  These computers can be used by students and come with R installed.</p>
				<hr>

				<h2 id="install-R">How do I install R and RStudio?</h2>
				<p>The easiest way to download R and RStudio is to just Google "download r" and "download rstudio" then follow the instructions for installing on your OS.  You will need to have Administrator Priviledges when installing (this could be a problem if you have been issued a computer by work).  If you have any troubles installing, please let me know.</p>
				<hr>

				<h2 id="late-homeworks">Will late homeworks be allowed?</h2>
				<p>Yes!  I want you to do your homeworks even if you are not able to complete them by the assigned date.</p>
				<p>Late homeworks will be accepted up to five class days after the original due date.  <strong>However, 10% of the points will be lost for each day the homework is late.</strong></p>
				<p>For example, if a homework worth 10 points is due on a Wednesday but you do not turn it in until Friday, one point will be deducted for being late.  If you do not turn it in until the following Monday, two points will be deducted for tardiness.  Three points will be deducted if it's turned in on the next Wednesday, four points on Friday, then five points on Monday.  The homework will not be accepted after that.</p>

				<h2 id="grading-scale">What is the grading scale?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><i>A</i> 93-100</li>
					<li><i>A-</i> 90-92</li>
				</ul>
