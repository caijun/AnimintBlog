			<div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12" id="answers">
				<h2 id="stat-216-required">Is STAT 216 required for this course?</h2>
				<p>Yes, you must have taken STAT 216 (or an equivalent course).  Stat 217 continues where STAT 216 left off so it is important that you have recently taken STAT 216.</p>
				<hr>

				<h2 id="textbook">Is the textbook required?  Can I use a previous edition of the textbook?</h2>
				<p>Yes, the textbook is required.  You can buy a paper copy from the bookstore for about $30.  Additionally, an ebook <a href="https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/2999">is available for download</a>.</p>
				<p>Older versions of the textbook are not recommended.  The book has substantially changed from Version 1 to Version 2 so we strongly encourage you to use the new book.</p>
				<hr>

				<h2 id="use-D2L">Will D2L be used for this course?</h2>
				<p>D2L will be used for grades only.  All content and scheduling announcements will be posted on this site.</p>
				<hr>

				<h2 id="need-computer">Do I need a computer?</h2>
				<p>A computer is not required, but it will be helpful to complete homeworks.</p>
				<p>If you do not have a computer, you will need to use a computer in either the Roberts Hall computer lab (ROBH 101) or the Reid Hall computer lab (REID 306).  These computers can be used by students and come with R installed.</p>
				<hr>

				<h2 id="install-R">How do I install R and RStudio?</h2>
				<p>The easiest way to download R and RStudio is to just Google "download r" and "download rstudio" then follow the instructions for installing on your OS.  You will need to have Administrator Priviledges when installing (this could be a problem if you have been issued a computer by work).  The text book also explains how to get started with R in Section 0.1 (page 8).  If you have any troubles installing, please let me know.</p>
				<hr>

				<h2 id="group-work">Are we allowed to work in groups?</h2>
				<p>Yes!  Group work is encouraged, but please have no more than five people to a group.</p>
				<hr>

				<h2 id="late-homeworks">Will late homeworks be allowed?</h2>
				<p>Yes!  I want you to do your homeworks even if you are not able to complete them by the assigned date.</p>
				<p>Late homeworks will be accepted up to five class days after the original due date.  <strong>However, 10% of the points will be lost for each day the homework is late.</strong></p>
				<p>For example, if a homework worth 10 points is due on a Wednesday but you do not turn it in until Friday, one point will be deducted for being late.  If you do not turn it in until the following Monday, two points will be deducted for tardiness.  Three points will be deducted if it's turned in on the next Wednesday, four points on Friday, then five points on Monday.  The homework will not be accepted after that.</p>
				<hr>

				<h2 id="grading-scale">What is the grading scale?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><i>A </i> 93-100</li>
					<li><i>A-</i> 90-92</li>
					<li><i>B+</i> 87-90</li>
					<li><i>B </i> 82-87</li>
					<li><i>B-</i> 80-82</li>
					<li><i>C+</i> 77-80</li>
					<li><i>C </i> 72-77</li>
					<li><i>C-</i> 70-72</li>
					<li><i>D+</i> 67-70</li>
					<li><i>D </i> 60-67</li>
					<li><i>F </i> less than 60</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>

				<h2 id="exam-materials">What can I bring to the exams?</h2>
				<p>You will need to bring a calculator to the exams.  This calculator is only needed for basic arithmetic (i.e. you do not need a graphing calculator).  Phones are not allowed.</p>
				<p>You are allowed one 8.5 x 11 sheet of notes for Exam 1 and Exam 2.  You are allowed two sheets for the final.  You may write on both the front and the back of these sheets.  These note sheets must be handwritten in <strong>your</strong> handwriting.  This means you may not make copies and share them with other students.  You must write your own notes.</p>
